# Physics Engine in C/C++

### Description
This project aims for building a 3D physics engine in plain C/C++ with an integrated graphics rendering

### Getting Started
the simplest way to get started is by running the command "make" at the root of the directory. This will compile and create an executable of "main.cpp".

### Dependencies
The current Makefile is made for MacOS, however with minor tweeks you should be able to build for Windows and Linux. The dependancies needed for this project are listed below :
-  OpenGL
-  SDL2
-  GLEW
-  GLM

### Features left to implement
-  Octree for collision detection
-  Mesh-wise collision detection
-  Object orientation
-  Inertia induced by collisions
-  Variable forces
-  Variable force vector-fields
-  Write real tests
